We have built a make up database exclusively for Witch. This is done by using exhaustive search and Amazon ItemLookup API.

* PHP files to get the frontend and backend connected.
* Witch101_LipsticksDB: originally collected information during development process. All info is now on the server.
* MySQL manual: How to upload the forementioned info onto EC2 instances.
* backlog: desscibes some expolartotry attemps such as inspecting other makeup databases to optimize virtual makeup accuracy.
