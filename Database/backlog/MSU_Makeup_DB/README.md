Brief information and I quote,
>YMU (YouTube Makeup dataset): Images obtained in 2012 from YouTube makeup tutorials corresponding to 151 Caucasian female subjects with 2 images before makeup and 2 images after makeup for each subject. Makeup varies from subtle to heavy. This dataset includes some variations in expression and pose. The illumination condition is reasonably constant over multiple shots of the same subject. In few cases, the hair style before and after makeup changes drastically. 
>VMU (Virtual Makeup dataset): Images of 49 Caucasian subjects from the FRGC dataset, to which makeup was synthetically added using the makeup tool Taaz. There are three virtual makeovers: (a) application of lipstick; (b) application of eye makeup; and (c) application of a full makeup consisting of lipstick, foundation, blush and eye makeup. Hence, the assembled dataset contains four images per subject: one before-makeup shot and three after makeup shots.
>MIW (Makeup in the Wild): The images are obtained from the internet and the faces are unconstrained. MIW contains 154 images: 77 images of subjects with makeup and 77 images of subjects without makeup.
