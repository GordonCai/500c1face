1. Download sublimetext, best editor ever ;)

2. Bootstrap is has html, some css (ie image and table) and some javascript (ie 
   button, popups and slideshow) built into it. 

3. If you want to try out bootstrap, just use the template.html, and open it with sublime, it has all the basic lib set up, no need to      download anything.

   If we need to run bootstrap at AWS (on Linux), we might need to install the uncomplied version with LESS (CSS complier). 

   Here are some additional Javascrip plugin to increase the funstions of our website. Such as:

4. I have also attached a complete list of Bootstrap class list (including buildin 
   CSS and javascript class): Bootstrap class list.pdf

To be continued.
