1. Download sublimetext, best editor ever ;)

2. Bootstrap is has html, some css (ie image and table) and some javascript (ie 
   button, popups and slideshow) built into it. 

3. If you want to try out bootstrap, download the complied version from:
   https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v3.3.6/bootstrap-3.3.6-dist.zip
   And put it int the same file where you put your html file.

   If we need to run bootstrap at AWS (on Linux), we might need to install the uncomplied version with LESS (CSS complier). 

   We can also add additional Javascrip plugin to increase the funstions of our website. Such as:
   http://tutorialzine.com/2013/07/50-must-have-plugins-for-extending-twitter-bootstrap/

4. Template.html is a empty bootstrap script for you to practice. I thas no CSS 
   font, but should be enough for practicing. Use w3schools to learn the component of bootstarp. 

5. I have also attached a complete list of Bootstrap class list (including buildin 
   CSS and javascript class): Bootstrap class list.pdf


6. To be continued.
